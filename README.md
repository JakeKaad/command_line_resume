# command_line_resume
Make yourself stand out with this here program.

## About
This was a project that spun off from a idea I had while listening to people talk about their job hunt on a bus.  
I thought it would be cool to have a resume that is a command-line application. Because programmers don't
use Word. They use real text-editors, like notepad. 

## Current status
Right now my own personal information is hardcoded in as a concept. I will move information into a text file to make
the application customizable. 

## Todo:
move contact information to text file
move skills to text file
custom options like text color, emoji support, custom application to run after resume runs.
